# Processing Pages Reference

Validated on: 2026-05-27

This document describes the current processing pages, the cards that are rendered on each page, the actions available inside those cards, the regressions that were fixed, and the test coverage used to verify the real development frontend and backend.

## Fixes Applied

- The catalog page regression was caused by heavy catalog queries and full in-memory source-catalog snapshot building during normal browse requests. Browse mode now uses lightweight, paginated catalog entry responses, while overview mode uses a separate summary path.
- Heavy book payload fields are now deferred in the catalog and ingestion querysets/serializers so list pages do not pull HTML blobs, raw scrape payloads, or large JSON fields unless they are actually needed.
- Processing pages now avoid unnecessary development-only duplicate frontend requests and avoid broad background polling when no active work exists, which reduced backend pressure and the worker-loss cascade seen during the failing runs.
- The local development worker now runs in Celery `solo` mode with single-task settings pinned in compose, which stopped the repeated prefork `SIGKILL` crashes while draining the existing submission backlog.
- The six-page processing dropdown has been replaced with four consolidated routes: `/catalog`, `/create`, `/on-hold`, and `/incomplete`. Old routes redirect automatically.

## Validated Edge Cases

- Large catalog browse against the current dev dataset with thousands of source rows, including sort changes, page changes, and rows-per-page changes.
- On Hold page layout: Paused, Failed, Duplicate, and Deleted cards each own one request bucket.
- Duplicate page behavior when the matched existing book has already been deleted: `New` and `New Edition` remain available.
- Submission and processing cards only expose state-valid actions such as `Pause`, `Resume`, `Retry`, `Create Again`, `Recreate`, and `Delete` when the underlying row actually supports them.
- Catalog rows correctly handle ready/open rows, stopped rows that can be resumed, deleted/local-book-missing rows, and non-creatable rows that remain read-only.
- Incomplete checks cover missing source categories, books removed from unfinished tracking, empty removed-history ranges, and single-row versus bulk reprocess flows.

## Shared Card Behavior

### Submission cards

These cards are reused across multiple pages under different titles such as `Requests`, `Automation Requests`, `Ready`, `Queued`, `Stopped`, and `Deleted`.

Common behavior:

- search and filter drawer
- row selection and select-all
- delete confirmation dialog

Bulk actions by state:

- default/request-style cards: `Stop selected`, `Delete selected`
- stopped cards: `Resume selected`, `Delete selected`
- deleted cards: `Add selected to queue`, `Delete selected`
- ready cards: `Delete selected`

Row actions by row state:

- `Open` when a linked book exists
- `Review` when a title match needs manual confirmation
- `Start` when a queued job has not been dispatched yet
- `Stop` while work is active
- `Resume` for stopped work
- `Retry` for failed or review-needed work
- `Add Again to Queue` for deleted requests
- `Recreate` when the previous linked book was deleted
- `Delete` on every submission row

### Processing job cards

These are the `Processing` cards.

Common behavior:

- search and filter drawer
- row selection and select-all
- bulk `Resume selected`
- bulk `Stop selected`
- bulk `Delete selected`

Row actions by row state:

- `Open` when a target book exists
- `Recreate` when the target book was deleted
- `Start` for queued-but-not-dispatched jobs
- `Stop` for active jobs
- `Resume` for stopped jobs
- `Retry` for failed jobs
- `Delete` for any row

### Duplicate card

Used on the On Hold page.

Common behavior:

- search and filter drawer
- row selection and select-all
- bulk `New selected`
- bulk `New Edition selected`
- bulk `Duplicate selected`
- bulk `Delete selected`

Row actions:

- `New`: dismiss duplicate and create a new book
- `New Edition`: treat as a new edition of the existing book
- `Duplicate`: confirm the existing book match
- `Delete`

### Failed requests card

Used on the failed page.

Common behavior:

- search and filter drawer
- row selection and select-all
- bulk `Retry selected`
- bulk `Delete selected`

Row behavior:

- rows expose request, step, status, updated time, and error details
- there are no row-level action buttons on this card

### Run history card

Used on pages with curation run history.

Common behavior:

- search and filter drawer
- row selection and select-all
- bulk `Stop selected`
- bulk `Delete selected`

Row actions:

- `Stop` for active runs
- `Delete` for any run row

### Review Match dialog

This modal appears after clicking `Review` on ambiguous submission rows.

Actions:

- choose a candidate to confirm the source
- close the dialog without confirming

## Page Map

The processing section now routes to four pages. Old `/processing-*` URLs redirect automatically to their new equivalents.

### `/catalog`

Heading: `Catalog`

Cards:

- `Catalog Overview`
- `Catalog Sync` (manual sync control)
- `Automation` (catalog automation settings)
- `Catalog Books`

`Catalog Sync` actions:

- `Sync catalog` / `Pause sync` / `Resume sync`

`Automation` card actions:

- enable/disable toggle
- set `Time`, `Frequency`, `Mode`, `Pages`
- `Save automation`

`Catalog Books` actions:

- search
- filter drawer
- sort chooser
- rows-per-page chooser
- pagination: `First`, `Prev`, `Next`, `Last`
- bulk `Create selected`
- bulk `Delete selected`
- row `Open` when a local ready book exists
- row `Create` for creatable rows
- row `Delete`

How it works:

- `Catalog Overview` is summary-only
- manual sync and catalog automation share the same catalog runtime and cannot run in parallel
- `Catalog Books` is the main source-catalog queue
- formerly split across `/processing-catalog-books` and `/processing-automation`

### `/create`

Heading: `Create`

Cards:

- `Create Overview`
- `Requests`
- `Queue`
- `Processing`
- `Created`

`Requests` bulk actions:

- `Delete selected`

`Queue` bulk actions:

- `Delete selected`

`Processing` bulk actions:

- `Pause selected`
- `Delete selected`

`Created` row action:

- `Open` when a linked book exists

`Created` bulk action:

- `Delete selected` (also deletes the linked book)

How it works:

- `Create Overview` shows live counts for Requests, Queue, Processing, and Created
- requests move through `requests → queue → processing → created`
- formerly at `/processing-my-requests`

### `/on-hold`

Heading: `On Hold`

Cards:

- `On Hold Overview`
- `Paused`
- `Failed`
- `Duplicate`
- `Deleted`

`Paused` bulk actions:

- `Resume selected`
- `Delete selected`

`Failed` bulk actions:

- `Retry selected`
- `Delete selected`

`Failed` row display:

- inline error reason shown as a detail column

`Duplicate` bulk actions:

- `New selected`
- `New Edition selected`
- `Duplicate selected`
- `Delete selected`

`Deleted` bulk action:

- `Create Again selected`

How it works:

- `On Hold Overview` shows live counts for Paused, Failed, Duplicate, and Deleted
- formerly split across `/processing-failed-requests` and `/processing-duplicate-requests`

### `/incomplete`

Heading: `Incomplete`

Cards:

- `Incomplete Overview`
- `Automation` (incomplete-check automation settings)
- `Incomplete` (source catalog records still marked incomplete)
- `Updated` (records resolved since last run)

`Automation` card actions:

- enable/disable toggle
- set `Time`, `Frequency`
- `Save automation` / sync run control

`Incomplete` card:

- read-only list of currently incomplete records

`Updated` bulk actions:

- `Recreate selected`
- `Delete selected`

How it works:

- `Incomplete Overview` shows live counts for Incomplete and Updated
- automation fetches the live `অসম্পূর্ণ বই` category and reconciles the local catalog
- resolved records move to `Updated` after the run completes
- formerly at `/processing-incomplete-check`

## REMOVED PAGES (redirect targets)

The following routes now redirect permanently:

| Old route                        | Redirects to  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `/processing-catalog-books`      | `/catalog`    |
| `/processing-automation`         | `/catalog`    |
| `/processing-my-requests`        | `/create`     |
| `/processing-failed-requests`    | `/on-hold`    |
| `/processing-duplicate-requests` | `/on-hold`    |
| `/processing-incomplete-check`   | `/incomplete` |

## Validation

### OBSOLETE SECTION BELOW

The routes, card names, and action labels in the following validation block reflect the old six-page model. They are kept for historical reference only.
