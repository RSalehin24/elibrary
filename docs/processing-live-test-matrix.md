# Processing Live Test Matrix

All scenarios below are intended for the real development application with no mocked processing data or synthetic remote page payloads.

## Deterministic Live Scenarios

| Area | Scenario | Runtime Scope | Expected Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Catalog | Manual sync start | `catalog` | Manual card becomes owner, automation run is disabled, catalog records hydrate during the run |
| Catalog | Manual pause and resume | `catalog` | Current page finishes, checkpoint persists, resume restarts from page 1 and reconciles through checkpoint |
| Catalog | Automation run button | `catalog` | Automation card becomes owner, manual run is disabled, runtime behavior matches manual flow |
| Catalog | Automation scheduler start | `catalog` | Scheduler-started run behaves the same as run-button start and appears on the automation card |
| Catalog | Post-sync request creation | `catalog` | Only records with no request history receive new initial requests |
| Catalog | Search/filter/count | `catalog-records` | Search/filter are server-side and count reflects full matched dataset |
| Catalog | Empty card hydration | `catalog-records` | Empty card becomes non-empty when live matching rows are reconciled |
| Create | Requests to Queue to Processing to Created | request pipeline | Only affected cards and create overview refetch on each real transition |
| On Hold | Paused / Failed / Duplicate / Deleted movement | request pipeline | Only source, destination, and affected overview cards refetch |
| On Hold | Created to Deleted to Create Again | request pipeline | Deleted card hydrates from the real row and the recreated request leaves Deleted for a live processing bucket |
| On Hold | Duplicate to New | request pipeline | Duplicate card loses the real row and the request re-enters live processing flow without mocked transitions |
| Incomplete | Run button start | `incomplete` | Incomplete records hydrate during the run and updated records appear after final diff |
| Incomplete | Scheduler start | `incomplete` | Scheduler run behaves the same as run-button start |
| Incomplete | Search/filter/count | `incomplete-records`, `Updated` | Counts reflect full matched datasets and filters stay card-local |
| Overviews | Aggregate-only refresh | all overview cards | Overviews refetch only when their own aggregates change |

## Best-Effort Live Scenarios

| Area | Scenario | Runtime Scope | Result Handling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Remote source | eBanglaLibrary outage during sync | `catalog` / `incomplete` | Verify behavior only if naturally observed in the live run |
| Remote source | Rate limiting or transient source failures | `catalog` / `incomplete` | Verify behavior only if naturally observed in the live run |
| Worker runtime | Worker crash or restart during processing | request pipeline | Verify behavior only if naturally observed in the live run |
| Source drift | Temporary omission of incomplete-category rows | `incomplete` | Verify behavior only if naturally observed in the live run |

## Acceptance Notes

- No Playwright route mocking is allowed for processing runtime coverage.
- No synthetic `remotePages` payload injection is allowed for processing runtime coverage.
- No seeded synthetic processing rows are allowed.
- Real data creation is allowed only through the real application flow itself.
