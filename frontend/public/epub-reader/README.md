## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main entry point for the EPUB reader web app.
- `static/` — All static assets grouped by type:
  - `static/css/base/` — Global base styles (`reset.css`, `iconfont.css`, `helpers.css`).
  - `static/css/components/` — UI component styles (`landing-screen.css`, `shortcuts-dialog.css`, `reader-layout.css`).
  - `static/css/themes/` — Theme tokens and theme overrides (`theme-tokens.css`, `theme-overrides.css`).
  - `static/js/app/` — App startup scripts (`boot-reader.js`, `pwa.js`).
  - `static/js/reader/` — Reader modules by responsibility:
    - `reader-application.js` — App orchestration and lifecycle.
    - `controllers/` — Focused controllers (theme, loading, shortcuts, iframe bridge, settings panel).
    - `utils/` — Shared DOM, TOC, and gesture helpers.
    - `reader-settings.js` — Constants/selectors/theme defaults.
  - `static/js/vendor/epub-runtime/` — EPUB engine loader (`runtime-entry.js`, `module-loader.js`) and responsibility-based runtime module groups.
  - `static/img/` — Image assets (logo, favicon, app icons).
- `CNAME` — Custom domain config (for GitHub Pages or similar hosting).

## Usage

1. Serve the project from a local/static web server and open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click "Open EPUB book" and select an EPUB file from your device.
3. Use the sidebar to navigate chapters, the top bar for settings, and the main area to read.
4. Adjust font size, switch themes, or enter fullscreen for immersive reading.
5. In Chrome, use the install icon in the address bar (or menu > "Install app") to install it.

### Backend launch manifest mode

The reader also supports a backend-issued launch contract:

- `/?manifest=<absolute manifest url>`

When that query parameter is present, the reader fetches the manifest, opens the protected EPUB automatically, and syncs reading progress back through the backend-provided `reading_session_url`.

## Testing

Run the local contract tests (no external dependencies):

```bash
node --test tests/*.test.mjs
```

Optional JavaScript syntax validation:

```bash
for file in $(rg --files -g '*.js' .); do node --check "$file"; done
```

Optional browser smoke tests (requires Playwright installed with browsers):

```bash
node --test tests/playwright-smoke.test.mjs
```

## Deployment

This project is static and can be hosted on any web server or GitHub Pages. The `CNAME` file is for custom domain support.
For installability, serve it over HTTPS (or `http://localhost` during development).
